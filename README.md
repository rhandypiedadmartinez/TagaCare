Project  Overview
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being incorporated into more and more areas of our lives in this age of rapidly developing technology. We introduce TagaCare, a ground-breaking effort that aims to improve healthcare accessibility through a Tagalog-speaking chatbot, in recognition of the significance of easily accessible and user-friendly healthcare information.
The streamlit chatbot called "TagaCare" aims to close the informational divide between those looking for health-related information and the wide field of medicine. The project's focal point is a chatbot that speaks Tagalog and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver precise, dependable, and culturally appropriate information in Filipino.

TagaCare is not just a chatbot; it's a commitment to making healthcare knowledge accessible to all. By offering a reliable and culturally sensitive platform for health-related queries, TagaCare contributes to the well-being of the Filipino community and beyond.
